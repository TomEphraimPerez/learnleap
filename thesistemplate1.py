Solve the Problem by Sampling
D-Wave‚Äôs quantum cloud service provides cloud-based hybrid solvers you can submit arbitrary QMs to.
These solvers, which implement state-of-the-art classical algorithms together with intelligent allocation
of the quantum processing unit (QPU) to parts of the problem where it benefits most, are designed to
accommodate even very large problems.
Ocean software‚Äôs dwave-system LeapHybridCQMSampler class enables you to easily incorporate Leap‚Äôs hybrid

# TUNING THE SOLUTION
	# # TUNING THE SOLUTION !
# RECALL - The objective function must maximize Expression of the diet‚Äôs Pt while minimizing purchase Plasticity.
	# So re min Plasticity, COST_min  = min SUMMA_i (qty_i * cost_i)
	#	            TASTE_max  = max SUMMA_i (qty_i * taste_i)
	
	# To optimize two different objectives, Expression and Plasticity, requires weighing one AGAINST the other.
	 
 	# A simple way to do this, is to set priority weights; for example,
        #	OBJective = alpha(obj_1) + beta(obj_1). eg alpha can = 2, beta can = 1,
	    #	ie you double the priority of the first objective compared to the second.

This diet is ranked as less tasty than the previous but much cheaper. 
It relies mainly on TNFùõºC and uses IL-6C to add ACTivation and DIFFerentiation.
'''
'''
Because of the differences in energy scale between the two parts of the combined objective,
177 >> 3,  if you do not multiply the part representing Plasticity by some positive factor, optimal 
solutions will maximize Expression and neglect Plasticity. That is, if in 
obj - alpha(obj1 + beta(obj2)), you set alpha=1=beta.
solutions will likely be 
  close or 
  identical 
to those found when optimizing for Expression alone.
